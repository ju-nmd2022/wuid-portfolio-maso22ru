                    Hi, my name is Sofia and I am twenty nine years old. I live on the countryside north of Jönköping   with my boyfriend Johan and our pets. The best about living on the countryside is that it is quiet, there is greenery all around me and I can surround myself with animals. Today, we have two cats, one dog, a couple of hens and quails. But I long for more.. 
                    A lot of my free time is spent in the kitchen, either for cooking or baking.  I love to bake, but unfortunately my creations would fit in the show "nailed it"...
                </p> 
                <p>
                    There is room for approvement there, and wouldn’t life be ever so boring if everything would be perfect? 
                    If I’m not in the kitchen, I will probably be in the sofa watching a movie or binge watching some series. A weekend is best spent, first, cruising around in a couple of thrift shops and look for kitschy treasures. After that, it is time for a nice walk in the woods with my dog, maybe to find some mushrooms to make a toast of for the evening. When the evening comes, we invite some friends over and plays some boardgames.

                why am i in NMD?
            </div>
            <p>
                Before I started the New Media Design program at Jönköping University I worked as a truckdriver. I worked night and drove to Oslo and Copenhagen. I been working as a truckdriver for almost 10 years, so I felt that I needed to do something else now. I was sick of working in the night and miss out all evening’s activities, I just wanted to be home more and get a life rhythm like everyone else. I applied for NMD because it seems to be a fun education and I know that I want to work in that field. 
                But I am open and eager to see all the other possibilities and paths that awaits in this field of work.
